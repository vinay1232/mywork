                    Yes, it is mandatory to attend National Conventions organized by an organization, if you want to participate in our Business / Mission. You will be barred from all the benefits of sales and marketing. But in case you could not attend due to some unavoidable circumstances, you need to write a letter to the company with the documentary proof for justifying your circumstances. On the basis of the documents produced by you, the company would decide whether to waive your attendance or not. The decision of the company would be final.

                   This is a difficult one to answer. You really have to answer the following questions about yourself to find out.
A. Are you self-motivated?
B. Are you willing to learn and able to pass on your knowledge?
C. Do you want a different way of working?
D. Are you determined to succeed?
E. Do you have 10-15 hours a week to work this business?
         If you answered yes to all of the above then Network Marketing is definitely for you. Most people fail because one of the above is lacking in some way which affects their confidence. It is determination and commitment that keeps you going after being knocked back.
